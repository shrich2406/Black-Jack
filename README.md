How to Play
When you run the game, you'll be prompted to enter your name & Chips worth. Press enter to continue.
You'll then be dealt two cards, and the dealer will be dealt one card face up.
The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over.
You can choose to "hit" and receive another card, or "stand" and keep your current cards.
If you go over 21 points, you "bust" and lose the game.
Once you're satisfied with your hand, the dealer will reveal their face-down card and draw additional cards as necessary to reach a total of 17 points or more.
If the dealer goes over 21 points, you win the game.
If the dealer has a higher point total than you without going over 21, you lose the game.
If you and the dealer have the same point total, the game ends in a tie.
